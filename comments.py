# TODO
# Do the issue title and issue body part
# Make the issue
# Catch errors, return descriptive ones
# Make sure you can't do .git help or something when we're waiting for a repo name
# Change how .git ev works



# DONE
# Make sure makeissue can't be called multiple times
# Cancel everything when .git cancel is called

# Maybe make some .git status so that we can check the current status in the issue making thing: currently set repo name, issue title, issue body, etc.
