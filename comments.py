# TODO
# Do the issue title and issue body part
# Make the issue
# Catch errors, return descriptive ones
# Make sure you can't do .git help or something when we're waiting for a repo name
# Change how .git ev works



# DONE
# Make sure makeissue can't be called multiple times
# Cancel everything when .git cancel is called

# Maybe make some .git status so that we can check the current status in the issue making thing: currently set repo name, issue title, issue body, etc.


# possibly make a req class
#class github req
# properties (See below comment)
# list of these comments
# associated with author
# can make multiple at once
# would be cool beo
